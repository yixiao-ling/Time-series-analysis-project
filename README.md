# Time-series Analysis : Nifty-50 stock price dataset

 In this notebook, I have explored various feature engineering techniques and models exclusive to time series data.

 Goal of this project was to explore the techniques to handle stock data. I started of with visualizing the various parameters to get an idea of the trends in data, seasonality, if its present etc. Next, I explored a few engineering techniques to generate exogenous features. Then I used models such as ARIMA, Autoregressors, LSTMs and RNNs to see which models best predict the target variable.
